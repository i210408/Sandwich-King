# Sandwich-King

There is a festival going on, and you have opened a new sandwich stand where you make custom sandwiches based on what your customers want. However, the customers never give you an exact description of what kind of ingredients they want inside their sandwich, leaving you to choose the correct ingredients based on the vague descriptions provided to you. Understand your customer and pick the right ingredients to make the best sandwiches ever.


The goal of the game is to maximize customer satisfaction by understanding customer requirements and then choosing the best possible ingredients that will lead to a sandwich that the customer will enjoy.
